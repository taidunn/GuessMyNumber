# Random-Number-Game
ALL files excluding the README.md are created through Eclipse, then copied to Atom to transfer to the selected repository within GitHub. 

MUST use Java Compiler to run this code. My recommendation is to download Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) or use https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler.

# Version 1.0: 
This is a basic random number game...
You will enter a number between 1 and 100 and a random math number generator will choose a number between 1 and 100.
It will tell you who had the highest number, and if you have won.

# Version 1.2
This is a bit more advanced.
Now, this version introduces a "while" loop. This loop will continuosly ask you for a new number until your number is higher than the generated number.

# Version 2.0
This version uses no "while" loop. 
However, it will continuously ask you for a new number until your number is higher or you have passed your 10th attempt.
You are limited to 10 attempts.
Uses more than one method, and incorperates them together to work correctly.

# Version 2.4
In Progress...
