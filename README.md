# Random-Number-Game
MUST use Java Compiler to run this code. My recommendation is to download Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) or use https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler.

This is a basic random number game...
You will enter a number between 1 and 100 and a random math number generator will choose a number between 1 and 100.
It will tell you who had the highest number, and if you have won.
